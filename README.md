# Project For Progamer Quiz Web Site

The website https://playfootball.games/ is a site where you can solve various quizzes on the subject of soccer players.

I decided to proceed with the project because I thought it would be good to bring ideas for quizzes and incorporate them into professional gamers. 

In this project, we organized a series of quizzes for users to solve using various information such as the history of professional 
gamers in the game League of Legends (LOL) and the number of wins in various competitions.

- Who Are You?
  Who are you? is a quiz that combines hints to guess a specific player.

  There are a total of eight challenges, and six lists are given for each challenge.

  The list is league, team, position, age, number of wins in domestic competitions, 
  and number of wins in international competitions, respectively.

  The list that matches the correct player in that list is shown in green, 
  the inconsistent list is maintained in color, and the specific list is given an up-down hint.

  You can solve the quiz by combining those hints.
