# Project For Progamer Quiz Web Site

The website https://playfootball.games/ is a site where you can solve various quizzes on the subject of soccer players.

I decided to proceed with the project because I thought it would be good to bring ideas for quizzes and incorporate them into professional gamers. 

In this project, we organized a series of quizzes for users to solve using various information such as the history of professional 
gamers in the game League of Legends (LOL) and the number of wins in various competitions.
